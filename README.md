# node-v3-chat-app
My first chat application
Developed a robust chat application as my first foray into real-time communication software, utilizing Node.js.
This project involved leveraging technologies such as Express for server-side logic,
WebSocket for real-time bidirectional communication, and JavaScript for front-end development.
Demonstrated skills in creating intuitive user interfaces and implementing efficient back-end processes,
ensuring smooth and responsive chat interactions.
This application serves as a testament to my proficiency in modern web technologies and my ability to craft dynamic, user-centric web solutions.
